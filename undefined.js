//difference between undefined and not defined 
//undefined is only present in JS

//js will try to allocate the memory to a and in the first pass the line is executed a will get undefined

//undefined doesnt mean empty it is a speacial keyword that can be use as a placeholder
console.log(a);
var a = 7;
console.log(`Value of a after allocation ${a}`);
var b = null
console.log(b);
