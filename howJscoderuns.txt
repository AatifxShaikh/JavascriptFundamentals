javascript code runs in the execution context it consist of mainly two components:
    1.Memory
    2.code
During the first phase the memory gets allocated for the entire code
then the second phase is code execution phase.
Whenever a function gets invocated a brand new execution context gets created for that function.    
After the execution of the function is over the whole execution context of that function gets deleted.

javascript has its own callStack
callStack gets populated by global execution context
